TranslateRoutes
===============

To whom it may concern:

This is a fork of [translate_routes](http://github.com/raul/translate_routes/tree) tweaked to only translate the route between the "localized" scope and has a fix for translating routes with the dash character (-) too.

Use it at your own risk. WIP.
